## Intuitive website that utilizes MySQL and Node.js along with Express.js and Sequelize to allow users to plan out their road trips and map them out. Site can store date ranges along with places to visit at your destination and what days you plan on seeing these sites. Can edit/delete/add very easily on our site. Looking to add Spotify to our site for customizable roadtrip playlists.

Please visit our deployed site via Heroku at [Heroku](https://roadie2017.herokuapp.com/)
